Made by Wiggle and Firecracker

Bruni's Utilities is a single server bot for the server [Dank Merchants](https://discord.gg/merchants)
This bot is made from [`discord.py`](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)


#### Here is a full guide of manager commands for new managers:
General Commands:
`b!d` - Check yours or someone else's donations for the server
`b!top` - Check the top donators in the server
`b!init` - This command is only a backup command incase there is an error in the database and the user was not in correctly

Tracking Commands:
* `b!gda` - Add someones giveaway donations
* `b!hda` - Add someones heist donations
* `b!eda` - Add someones event donations
* `b!sda` - Add someones special event donations
* `b!mda` - Add to someones money donations

All commands have a remove, set, reset command also
* `b!gdr` - remove
* `b!gds` - set
* `b!gdrs` - reset

Permission wise all command core respond with the type of donation for the command so only giveaway managers can use giveaway commands and so on and so forth. The one that all managers can use are the special commands. Admin+ can bypass all commands
